Happy coding!

New text format conversion tool for csv file has been uploaded. <br>
[ File path ]: snippets/r/toolbox/csv-mix-to-utf8-v2.r <br>
[ Features ]: <br>
1) Mask highest bit of byte codes in the output stream to avoid illeagal character.
2) Output file name is changed to 'output-utf8-v2.csv', to avoid overwriting of the output generated by v1 code.
