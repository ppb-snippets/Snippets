1) Launch NotePad in windows

2) Load csv into Notepad: 
   a. Notepad menu: File -> Open
       In the open dialog:
       - Choose file type as "All Files(*.*)"  (inline with or follow 'File name')
       - Choose 'Encoding' as "UTF-8"
   b. Check the loaded content. 
      If the content is NOT readable or resonable, try (a.) again with Encoding=ANSI or =Unicode, etc.
      until the loaded content is readable and resonable.
      
3) Save another copy of CSV by Notepad:
   a. Notepad menu: File -> Save As
      In the 'Save As' dialog:
      - Name a output file such as 'mydata.csv' in the 'File name' field
      - Choose 'Save as type' as "All files(*.*)"
      - Choose 'Encoding' as "UTF-8"
   b. Check the output CSV file by excel to see if it is re-encoded correctly
   
4) Test the re-encoded csv file in R
   try 'read.csv("mydata.csv")' to load the csv file generated in step(3)
   

PS: Notepad is supposed to be able to deal with file not large than 1GB.
