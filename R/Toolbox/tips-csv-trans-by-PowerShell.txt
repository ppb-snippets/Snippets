Windows Powershell is a console terminal looking like the traditional CMD/DOS terminal but far more powerful.

1) Launch PowerShell
   Method-1: 
     a. Press 'Windows Key' + 'R' together.  ('Windows Key' is the key with a mark pattern like 'frame of a window')
     b. In the pop-up windows and after the 'Run' prompt, type "powershell" and press 'OK' or ENTER key
   Method-2:
     a. Click Windows Start icon (the big icon at the left-bottom corner of desktop)
     b. Choose Run 
     c. follow the instruction in (Method-2.b)
   When PowerShell is launched successfully, a DOS like terminal window pops up.
   
 2) PowerShell: change current directory to your R working directory
    Using "cd" command to change current directory of PowerShell:
    For example, there is a R working directory named as "d:\myworks", then type "cd d:\myworks"
    in PowerShell to change the current directory.
      
 3) PowerShell: re-encode CSV file
    Suppose you have a CSV file 'mydata.csv' to be re-encoded and it locates in "d:\myworks"
    a. Import CSV file and make a PowerShell object ($data):
       Type "$data = import-csv mydata.csv"
    b. Export PowerShell object ($data) to a CSV file, for example to "myoutput.csv":
       Type "$data | export-csv myoutput.csv -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation"
       
4) Check the output CSV file made with PowerShell commands:
   a. Open it in Excel
   b. Open it in R
