     b. In the pop-up windows after 'Run' prompt, input "powershell" and press 'OK' or ENTER key
   Method-2:
     a. Click Windows Start icon (the big icon at the left-bottom corner of desktop)
     b. Choose Run 
     c. follow the instruction in (Method-2.b)
   When PowerShell is launched successfully, a DOS terminal like window will pop up.
   
 2) PowerShell: change current directory to your R working directory
    Using "cd" command to change current directory:
      For example, there is a R working directory like "d:\myworks", then in powershell type "cd d:\myworks"
      
 3) PowerShell: re-encode CSV file
    Suppose you have a CSV file 'mydata.csv' to be re-encoded in "d:\myworks"
    a. Load CSV into PowerShell:
       in powershell window, type "$data = import-csv "
